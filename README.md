# Transcode
The **Transcoding Proxy** is an essential part of video processing system. ðŸŽ¥ It performs a crucial role in preparing videos for different devices, formats, and network conditions. Hereâ€™s a detailed description:

### **ðŸ”„ Transcoding Proxy:**

- **Function**: The Transcoding Proxy converts the original video uploaded by users into multiple formats, resolutions, and bitrates. ðŸ“¹ This process is called "transcoding."

- **Why It's Important**: 
  - It ensures that the video can be viewed on any device (smartphone, tablet, computer, TV) and under different internet speeds. ðŸ“±ðŸ’»ðŸ“º
  - Creates multiple versions of the video, like 144p, 240p, 360p, 720p, 1080p, and even up to 4K, so users can select the quality that suits their connection. ðŸ“¶

- **How It Works**:
  1. **Receives Original Video**: Takes the video from the main server after upload.
  2. **Converts Video**: Transcodes it into multiple formats (e.g., MP4 with H.264 codec) and resolutions.
  3. **Sends to Other Proxies**: Passes the transcoded versions to the CDN, caching, and other proxies for delivery to users. ðŸš€

**Summary**: The Transcoding Proxy ensures that every video is converted into different formats and quality levels, making it accessible and playable for all viewers, regardless of their device or internet speed. ðŸŽ¬ðŸŒŸ
